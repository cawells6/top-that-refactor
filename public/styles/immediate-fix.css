/*
  LOBBY LAYOUT MAINTENANCE:
  - This file ensures the lobby modal container is centered and visible from the first render.
  - If the lobby appears off-center or jumps, update centering rules here.
  - See also: style.css (.lobby-modal-container, .game-setup-content) and modals.css for modal flex centering.
  - .preload class on <html> ensures no FOUC (flash of unstyled content).
*/
