First things first: get rid of all your cards to win. When the pile is empty, you can play anything. Perfect time to discard those low cards!

## Notes on HTML Formatting

- Use `<strong>` tags for emphasized actions (e.g., `<strong>Play your 3</strong>`)
- Keep apostrophes escaped in the actual code (e.g., `you\'re` becomes `you're` in this doc)
- Special characters like quotes should be handled properly when importing back to code
