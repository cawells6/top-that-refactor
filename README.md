# Top That! Refactor

The most important rule of this project is accuracy. I want whatever code is written by AI to be accurate and holistic. It can take as long as it needs to, but it must be accurate. If it is not accurate, it will be rejected. I want AI to be the expert and dig into issues as much as possible to help me cultivate ideas and build a top-tier game.
